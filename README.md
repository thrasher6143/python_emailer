# python_emailer
A simple SMTP Python emailer

YOu will need to create a list of contacts.  format shoudld be:
/<name> /<email@address.com>

The message file can be any text for this. 
At the current initializtion it has no subject when sending,
but can be fixed with a slightly more complex code and another library.
